### Try it out : [here](https://tranquil-dawn-00256.herokuapp.com)

Users can order 10 different products. Each product is connected to the database and inventory is kept up with for each one. If a user tries to place an order for an item that doesn't have enough inventory, the app will let you know that the order can't be placed and to order less of that product.
